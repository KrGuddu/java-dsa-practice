Q. why use capital letter in string datatype? =>Introduction Q.N.5
❓ Why is String written with a capital S in Java?

Because String is a class, not a primitive data type.

🔹 Java data types are of two kinds:
1️⃣ Primitive types (lowercase):

int

double

char

boolean

These store simple values directly.

2️⃣ Reference types / Classes (Capitalized):

String

Scanner

ArrayList

Integer

These store references to objects.

🧠 So:
String name = "Guddu";

is correct because String is a built-in class provided by Java.

❌ string name = "Guddu"; → This is wrong and will cause a compile-time error.

🎯 In short:

We use a capital letter in String because:
👉 It is a class, and Java class names always start with a capital letter by convention.

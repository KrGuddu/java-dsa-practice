Q. why use capital letter in string datatype? =>Introduction Q.N.5
❓ Why is String written with a capital S in Java?

Because String is a class, not a primitive data type.

🔹 Java data types are of two kinds:
1️⃣ Primitive types (lowercase):

int

double

char

boolean

These store simple values directly.

2️⃣ Reference types / Classes (Capitalized):

String

Scanner

ArrayList

Integer

These store references to objects.

🧠 So:
String name = "Guddu";

is correct because String is a built-in class provided by Java.

❌ string name = "Guddu"; → This is wrong and will cause a compile-time error.

🎯 In short:

We use a capital letter in String because:
👉 It is a class, and Java class names always start with a capital letter by convention.

========================================= Solution 8 ================================================
🔹 Why do we use L in large numeric constants?
By default, all integer literals (like 2147483648) in Java are treated as int.
But the maximum value of int is: 2,147,483,647

So if you write:  2147483648   // ❌ This is TOO LARGE for int → Compile-time error
To tell Java, “This number is a long”, we add L: 2147483648L  // ✅ Now Java treats it as a long

🔹 Example from your code:
if (x >= -2147483648L && x <= 2147483647L)    ==>> Without L, this would cause a compile-time error, because 2147483648 is outside the int range.

🔹 Summary:
Literal	             Type Java Assumes
123	                 int
123L or 123l	     long

👉 Always use capital L, not lowercase l, because lowercase l looks like 1 and can be confusing.
If you want, I can also explain this for float vs double (F vs no suffix).

------------------------ Additional --------------------------
Let’s understand float vs double and why we use F (or f) suffix.

🔹 Default type for decimal numbers in Java: By default, all decimal literals (like 3.14) are treated as double, not float.

So this works: double d = 3.14;   // ✅ OK
But this does NOT: float f = 3.14;    // ❌ Compile-time error (double → float)

🔹 How to make a number a float?
Add F or f:

float f = 3.14F;   // ✅ Correct
float f2 = 3.14f; // ✅ Also correct

🔹 Summary Table
Literal         	Type
3.14	            double
3.14F           	float
3.14D	            double (optional, rarely used)

🔹 Rule of thumb:
Use L for long numbers.
Use F for float numbers.
No suffix → int (for whole numbers) or double (for decimals).
